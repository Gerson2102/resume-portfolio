# Web3 Developer & Open Source Contributor

I'm Gerson, a Web3 software developer from Costa Rica specializing in the Starknet ecosystem. I build decentralized applications, contribute to open source projects, and speak at blockchain conferences across Latin America.

## Current Focus
- **Starknet Ecosystem**: 20+ open source contributions via OnlyDust platform
- **Arbitration Technology**: Building Arkthemist, an arbitration-as-a-service platform
- **Developer Education**: Speaking about blockchain beyond speculation

## Recent Achievements
- **OnlyDust Fellowship 2025**: $1,000/month for 3 months of focused Starknet contributions
- **Ethereum Foundation Scholar**: <100 developers selected globally for Devconnect Argentina 2025
- **Hackathon Winner**: 2nd place at ETH Pura Vida with crypto trading application

## What Drives Me
I believe blockchain technology's true value lies in solving real problems, not just financial speculation. Whether it's building dispute resolution systems or contributing to core infrastructure, I focus on applications that improve how people interact and transact online.

My work spans from low-level protocol contributions in Rust and Cairo to full-stack dApps using modern web technologies. I've been selected for multiple competitive programs including the Invisible Garden residency (2024, 2025) and completed a 3-month internship at Nethermind working on Ethereum infrastructure.

## Open to Opportunities
I'm actively seeking full-time Web3 developer positions, particularly in:
- Starknet/Cairo development
- Ethereum infrastructure
- DeFi protocols
- Developer tooling
